      <div class="container" style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">
        <p>The pandemic has been an incredibly stressful time for most of us. It has taken a toll on our mental and physical health, and left many of us unemployed.</p>

        <p>However, the pandemic helped me gain a different perspective on life. I managed to break into the data science industry in the midst of a Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
          
        <p><b>Background</b></p>  
          
        <p>Since I was young, I have always enjoyed to solve puzzles.So thats how I look at big datasets: to me it is big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is the challenge to me.Before the pandemic started, I was living a relatively comfortable life.I was enjoying my college.</p>
          
        <p>All this changed when the government imposed a nationwide lockdown first time on 24 March,2020. 
          Suddenly, I could no longer do the things I liked anymore. I could no longer go out with friends or go to the college everyday. I was stuck at home with nothing to do.
          The upside of all of this&ndash;now that I had nothing to do, I could think clearly.
          I started thinking about the future. About what I wanted to do, and who I wanted to become.
          I took a piece of paper and started making a list of the different career options I had:</p>  
        <ul> 
          <li>Professor</li>
          <li>Data scientist</li>
          <li>Journalist</li>
        </ul> 
          <p>I watched videos and read articles on all of these career choices. I took a look at salaries, prospects, and job satisfaction.
          And machine learning really stood out to me. I started watching videos of AI applications.
          I watched, fascinated, as Watson (an AI application) beat the world champion at a game of Jeopardy.
          That was when I decided I was going to give it a try. I wanted to be part of the magic that created Watson. I wanted to pursue machine learning and work with data.</p>
          
          
          
          <p>So I enrolled into data science online courses on Internet, and started doing challenges on sites like W3resource,JavaPoint,GeeksforGeeks,Towards data science,etc.
          
          It was difficult.
          
          But I had an end goal in mind. And I decided to keep trying until I became really good at it.</p>
          
          <p>As I coded for 6 &ndash; 7 hours a day, I started to really enjoy it. I realized that my biggest barrier was my own fear.
          
          After getting over the initial fear that was holding me back, the rest fell into place pretty easily.</p>
          
          <p>In just a few months, I:
          
          <ul>
            <li>Taught myself Python</li>
            <li>Learnt the basics of data science and machine learning</li>
            <li>Built machine learning projects </li>
        </ul></p>
          
          <p>Not long after, my hard work paid off.
          I got an internship offer from a Codebiosis Private Limited company, Bengaluru. They were impressed with my projects.
          
          I was still studying at that time, and this was a full time internship opportunity.
          
          This meant that I had to juggle full-time studying with full-time working.
          
          But this wasn&prime;t an opportunity you&prime;d get everyday, so I said yes.</p>
          
          <p>Then, six Months later, I started working in the same company as a data scientist.</p>
          
          <p>In life, things happen to you that you don&prime;t expect. But sometimes, those things happen for the best.
          
          
          
          </p>
